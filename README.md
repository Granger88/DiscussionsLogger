# DiscussionsLogger.js
DiscussionsLogger.js is a Node.js application to log Discussions post from a FANDOM site to a Discord Webhook.
The script can be useful for checking for updates on specific threads, such as if you have a verification system in place that requires users to comment on that thread.
